# Games Engines 1 Assignment 2018-2019

This project will be an audio visualizer that represents played audio visually using mainly unity particle effects inspired by the [MilkDrop](http://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/) plugin for Winamp and also the [Waves](https://danielpalacios.info/waves) project by Daniel Palacios.

The audio sequencing will be done unsing fast Fourier transforms followed by a resampling to partition the audio appropriately. 
Whereas particle density will be indicated by the sampled sound, particle movement will propably be controlled by a perlin noise family algorithm.
